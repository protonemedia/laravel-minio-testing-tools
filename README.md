## Laravel Splade

**Did you hear about Laravel Splade? ü§©**

It's the *magic* of Inertia.js with the *simplicity* of Blade. [Splade](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-splade) provides a super easy way to build Single Page Applications using Blade templates. Besides that magic SPA-feeling, it comes with more than ten components to sparkle your app and make it interactive, all without ever leaving Blade.

## Features
* Starts and configures a MinIO server for your tests.
* Updates the `filesystems` disk configuration.
* Updates and restores the `.env` file.
* Works with [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/dusk).
* Works on [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)
* Compatible with Laravel 10.
* PHP 8.1 or higher is required.

## Installation

Make sure you've downloaded the [MinIO Server and Client](https://min.io/download#/linux) for your OS.

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require protonemedia/laravel-minio-testing-tools --dev
```

Add the trait to your test, and add the `bootUsesMinIOServer` method:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Browser;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseMigrations;
use ProtoneMedia\LaravelMinioTestingTools\UsesMinIOServer;
use Tests\DuskTestCase;

class UploadVideoTest extends DuskTestCase
{
    use DatabaseMigrations;
    use UsesMinIOServer;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();

        $this->bootUsesMinIOServer();
    }

    /** @test */
    public function it_can_upload_a_video_using_multipart_upload()
    {
    }
}
```

That's it!

## GitHub Actions

The easiest way is to download the MinIO Server and Client before the tests are run:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Download MinIO S3 server and client
        run: |
          wget https://dl.minio.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio -q -P /usr/local/bin/
          wget https://dl.minio.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc -q -P /usr/local/bin/
          chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minio
          chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mc
          minio --version
          mc --version
```

If you're using `php artisan serve`, make sure you don't use the `--no-reload` flag, as the `.env` file will be changed on-the-fly.

Optionally, if you want persistent storage across the test suite, you may start the server manually before the tests are run.

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Download MinIO S3 server and client
        run: |
          wget https://dl.minio.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio -q -P /usr/local/bin/
          wget https://dl.minio.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc -q -P /usr/local/bin/
          chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minio
          chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mc
          minio --version
          mc --version

      - name: Run MinIO S3 server
        run: |
          mkdir ~/s3
          sudo minio server ~/s3 --json > minio-log.json &

      - name: Configure MinIO S3
        run: |
          mc config host add local http://127.0.0.1:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
          mc admin user add local user password
          mc admin policy set local readwrite user=user
          mc mb local/bucket-name --region=eu-west-1

      - name: Upload Minio Logs (optional)
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: minio
          path: minio-log.json
```

In this case, you also need to supply an environment file with the MinIO configuration. This makes the configuration also accessible by the browser session when you're running Laravel Dusk.

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=user
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=password
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1
AWS_BUCKET=bucket-name
AWS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9000
AWS_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:9000
AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT=true
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
